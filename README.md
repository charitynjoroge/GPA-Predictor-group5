# GPA Predictor 📘

This Jupyter Notebook predicts a student's GPA based on the number of study hours per week using linear interpolation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: For logic and computation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visualization.
- **Tkinter**: For building a simple GUI.
- **Linear Interpolation**: To estimate GPA between defined study hour ranges.

## 📊 How It Works

- A sample dataset maps study hour ranges (e.g., "4-6") to GPA scores.
- The user inputs study hours.
- The app finds the correct GPA range or interpolates between ranges to predict the GPA.
- A Tkinter interface makes it interactive and user-friendly.

## ▶️ Running the Notebook

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. The GUI window will appear—enter your study hours and see the predicted GPA.

## 📘 Example

```python
study_hours = 7
predicted_gpa = 2.7
